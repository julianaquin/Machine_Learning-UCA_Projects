It is clear that accurate predic3ons of energy consumption for a given building as a func3on of its characteristics can help policy makers target renovation efforts in order to maximise emissions reductions.
The data we will be using comes from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and the work to be carried out consists of analysing differences in the energy efficiency of buildings in order to build one or more models to predict the energy consumption of buildings.
To do this, the data provided describes the characteris3cs of the buildings and the clima3c and meteorological variables for the regions in which the buildings are located.
